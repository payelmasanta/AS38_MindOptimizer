The attached files DO NOT work as a standalone project.

If you want to run the code, you can do that as well. Follow these steps

Create a new Flutter project via "flutter create some_project" command in the command prompt.
Replace the lib folder and the pubspec.yaml file with the attached files
Possibly add assets like images or fonts or adjust the AndroidManifest.xml / Info.plist file to add data permissions
Run the command "flutter packages get" in the studio terminal.
flutter run (with a running emulator or real device connected to your machine) to view the app.
